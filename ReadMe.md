Based on the original Atari game Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them.

this game was created with vanilla HTML, JS, and SCSS.

Upon first load the game will not start until the play button is clicked. Once clicked the ball will start to move towards the paddle. The paddle is controlled using just the arrow keys.

at the very top of the screen there is a counter of how many blocks are elimnated.

If all blocks are eliminated a win screen will display followed by a continue screen.

If the player allows the ball to hit the bottom of the play area a lose screen will display followed by a continue screen.
